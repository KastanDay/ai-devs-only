The file "web_scraper/output.json" is an output file, not a code file. It will be generated and filled with data when the web scraper is run. Initially, it can be empty or not even exist. The Scrapy framework will create it and fill it with scraped data in JSON format when the web scraper is run. Therefore, there is no code to generate for this file.
